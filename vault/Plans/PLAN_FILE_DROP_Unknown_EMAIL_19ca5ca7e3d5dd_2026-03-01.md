- [ ] Read and refine the draft output below
- [ ] Verify tone, accuracy, and completeness
- [ ] Approve or reject via `/Pending_Approval/`
- [ ] Once approved (or no action needed), log result and archive original

# Draft Output _(DRAFT ONLY — DO NOT SEND WITHOUT APPROVAL)_

    Review checklist:
    1. Open and inspect the file contents
    2. Identify required action (respond / archive / process)
    3. Draft appropriate response if needed

    [TODO — complete this section after reviewing the file.]

# Approval Gate

# Completion Criteria

- [ ] Audit log entry written to `/Logs/`
- [ ] `Dashboard.md` updated with latest counts
- [ ] Approval request present in `/Pending_Approval/`
