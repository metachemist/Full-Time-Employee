### Message Body

Hi,

I came across your profile through a recommendation from a mutual contact. We're a mid-sized e-commerce company looking for someone to handle our social media presence across Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

We have a budget of around $2,000–$3,000/month and would love to get a quote for your services. Could you send us a proposal outlining what you'd include in that package?

We'd ideally like to start within the next two weeks if possible.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Sarah Chen
Marketing Director, Acme Corp
