# Payload

## Message / Content

  Just shipped something exciting: a fully autonomous AI Employee built on Claude Code + Obsidian.

  It watches Gmail and LinkedIn 24/7, drafts responses, and only acts after human approval.

  The stack:
  → Claude Code as the reasoning engine
  → Obsidian vault as shared memory and dashboard
  → Python watchers for Gmail and LinkedIn
  → Human-in-the-loop for every outbound action

  No action is taken without your approval. Every send, every post — logged and auditable.

  This is what autonomous AI looks like in 2026.
